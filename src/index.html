        <h1>Gluten-free Macadamia-Apricot Swiss Roll with Coconut Flakes</h1>
    </header>

    <section class="introduction">
        <p>Today it's time for the last recipe, that we made for freunde von freunden's 'afternoon tea series'. We made our first swiss roll last spring and since then, we totally forgot to make one again. I have no idea how that could happen, isn't a swiss roll just simply delicious?! Anyways, so here is finally a new swiss roll recipe - this time with apricot jelly, ginger, macadamia-cream and coconut flakes.</p>

        <p>I think this is one of those recipes were you just can't believe that you are eating a glutenfree cake. I have this a lot of times when I eat Nora's recipes, I always can't believe, that I almost missed 3 years of eating cake, just because I thought it wouldn't be possible to make a good glutenfree version. Now I'm more than happy, that Nora shows me that it works perfectly each time again and again and I'm sure you will love this cake as well! We hope you have a lovely Easter weekend guys - we are going back to enjoy the sun in the garden now with a big piece of swiss roll.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients & Instructions</h2>

        <h3>Sponge Dough</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>60g rice flour (or regular flour)</li>
            <li>45g corn starch</li>
            <li>1,5 tsp tartar baking powder (or regular baking powder)</li>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
            <li>90g sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 vanilla pod</li>
            <li>1 dash salt</li>
        </ul>

		<ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 190 degrees Celsius (top/bottom heat). Line a baking sheet with baking parchment (take care that the sides and corners are covered).</li>
            <li>Separate the eggs. Beat egg whites together with a dash of salt until half stiff, then add half of the sugar while continuing beating until stiff.</li>
            <li>Now beat the egg yolks together with the remaining sugar and vanilla seeds for 1-2 minutes. Fold the egg-yolk-cream gently into the beaten egg whites.</li>
            <li>Mix rice flour, corn starch, and tartar baking powder in a separate bowl and sift in 3 portions to the egg-mix. Fold in gently with a big (wooden) spoon.</li>
            <li>Pour the dough on the parchment paper and spread the dough with an angled spatula evenly. Bake for 10 minutes at 190°C.</li>
            <li>Turn the baked dough upside down on a sugared kitchen towel, take off the parchment carefully, and roll the dough with the towel. Leave to cool on a cooling rack.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Filling</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>250g apricot jam</li>
            <li>Small piece fresh ginger</li>
            <li>50g macadamia (or other nuts you like)</li>
            <li>20g coconut flakes (or grated coconut)</li>
            <li>200g heavy cream</li>
            <li>100ml milk</li>
            <li>2-3g agar-agar (or another gelling agent)</li>
            <li>1-2 tbsp sugar</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="images/image 1.png" alt="Swiss Roll Image 1">
        <ol>
            <li>Shred the coconut flakes with an immersion blender (cover the bowl with a kitchen towel, because the coconut grates can come flying out easily). Purée the macadamia nuts, they will turn to a nut cream.</li>
            <li>Beat the heavy cream semi-stiff, then add the sugar and beat until stiff. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Mix the milk with the agar-agar in a small saucepan, bring to a boil for one minute, let cool for 2-3 minutes in a medium-sized bowl (stir occasionally).</li>
            <li>Stir in the macadamia cream and grated coconut.</li>
            <li>Gently fold in the whipped cream in 3-4 portions.</li>
            <li>Roll the dough, mix the apricot jam with some grated fresh ginger and spread the jam on the dough. Spread half of the macadamia-coconut cream on the jam (leave a thin gap at the edges).</li>
            <li>Roll up the Swiss roll, spread the remaining macadamia-coconut cream on top, and decorate with coconut flakes and chopped macadamia nuts.</li>
            <li>Refrigerate for at least 1 hour before serving. Cut off the sides before serving.</li>
        </ol>
